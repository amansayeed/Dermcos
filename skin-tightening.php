<p>The Hollywood Laser Peel, also known as the Spectra Peel or carbon peel, is a mildly exfoliating and resurfacing procedure that improves the appearance of fine wrinkles, pigment, pores, and acne.</p>
<p>The procedure consists of three parts. First, a black carbon solution is applied to the skin. Then, a laser is used to heat the carbon and help it to penetrate the skin. Finally, we change the setting on the laser and the laser explodes the microscopic carbon particles, which has a resurfacing and exfoliating effect.</p>
<p>The laser feels like a pin prick on the skin, so it would not be considered painful or uncomfortable. The effect of the procedure is practically immediate, and there is no downtime. Without a long recovery time, the Hollywood Laser Peel is an efficient treatment that can help you avoid the frustrations of other similar procedures.</p>
<p>The Hollywood Laser Peel can be used safely on all skin types and is most useful when the skin is already healthy or only mildly damaged. If skin damage is significant it may be better to start with another laser. If your skin is healthy, the Hollywood Laser Peel can be repeated as often as desired to maintain its healthy glow or to prepare for a special event.</p>
<p>This treatment can be a great way to look your best at any occasion or in your daily life, similar to our many other treatments. Our Hollywood Laser Peel treatment combines innovative technology with expertise to give you consistently great results with every visit. We have the capabilities to give you the service you want with a consultation that can help determine what the best treatment will be.</p>
