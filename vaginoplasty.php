             <p>Vaginal tighteningThe procedure is also known as vaginoplasty. Frequent sexual intercourses can lead to a vaginal opening that is roomier. This can result in less friction leading to inadequate sexual pleasure. As a result, women complain that they are dissatisfied. Surgical remedies like vaginal tightening can be performed for correcting this condition.</p>

			<p>In vaginal tightening, some mucosa is removed from the vagina. After doing this, the muscles underlying the mucosa are tightened. This decreases the space of the vaginal opening. Increased penetration can be attained, resulting in more sexual pleasure. Recovery time for this surgery is 1 to days. Normal sexual activity can be started after 3 weeks from the surgery date.</p>
