            <p>Our bodies tend to produce certain hormones known as Androgens that are responsible for the oil production on your skin. This excess sebum or oil can clog your pores, which results in the outbreak of acne. Acne commonly occurring in teens can be either occasional breakouts or can be the severe acne, blackheads and whiteheads. Acne can be a matter of great distress in children as well as teens that makes them emotionally withdraw from school and activities with their friends, making children and teenagers to be introvert and awkward in social situations. Fortunately, acne can be treated successfully. Most skin conditions due to acne can be alleviated easily by following a regular and good skin care regimen. However, one may need further diagnosis and therapy from a dermatologist which becomes quite important when all other method fails to clear up your acne.</p>
