			<p>
The innate desire of looking forever young has made women try different things for retain their beautiful self. They are in a constant endeavour to defy both genetics and calendar by adopting various lifestyle changes, food habits and beauty treatments they undergo. One such treatment that has taken the anti-ageing market by storm is the PRP treatment (platelet-rich plasma treatment), also known by the name of vampire facial( due to the fact that plasma from your own blood is used). This method was previously used in sports injuries is now slowly and gradually becoming the choice of cosmetic treatment for fighting the visible signs of ageing like wrinkles, dark spots, dark circles and sagging skin. The PRP uses the body’s own plasma instead of injecting some sort of chemical into the skin, making it an organic beauty treatment choice.

<h5>The procedure of PRP treatment 
</h5>
<li>In this procedure, the blood is drawn from the arm of the patient about to receive the treatment. </li>

<li>Prior to starting the treatment, it needs to be ensured that our patients’ skin is cleaned thoroughly with no residue left and the full numbing period has ended.
 </li>

<li>After the blood is drawn, the blood is centrifuged for separating out the PRP solution from the rest of the blood.
 </li>

<li>The full sample is then brought and the PRP is injected into the skin using a syringe.
 </li>
<li>After this, your body’s own PRP solution is then applied to the face (or any other body area being treated) while a micro-needling pen glides slowly across the treatment surface. 
 </li>
<li>The microneedle pen then goes deep into the dermis level which will lead to some surface-level blood visibly appearing on the top of the skin. 
 </li>
<li>The micro-injuries are stimulating deep collagen production, while the PRP is able to penetrate deep into the skin to promote healing, minimize inflammation and support skin rejuvenation.
 </li>

<li>After this treatment, the skin will appear to be extremely red and might sting or a tightening feeling may persist. This may last for 1-3 days that eventually vanishes within 24 hours.  
 </li>


<li>It is highly recommended that patients follow the post-care instructions, which are when to visit the skin clinic next and what appointment (if required) to be taken, what type of skincare to be used and what are things that must be avoided that must be direct sunlight,  retinol-based products and over-exfoliation).

 </li>
 
<p>The results will be visible within 1-2 weeks and make your skin feel young and rejuvenated once again.
