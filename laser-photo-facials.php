Loose skin, the drooping effect on the skin are the major problems which appear with the age. With the help of laser techniques, one can get rid of these age-related skin problems. Intense pulsed light (IPL)jawline stimulates and grows new collagen, which improves skin texture, tone and fights fine lines and wrinkles. Near-infrared light is the laser technique which creates deep heating to the skin. This technique facilitates skin tightening and treating the loose skin around the eye, nose, and jaw line giving a more youthful appearance.

<p>A dermatologist should give instructions to avoid sunlight exposure prior to the treatment and for a few weeks after treatment. Before the treatment begins a topical anesthetic may be applied to the affected area. After the application of a cooling gel into the skin, a series of pulses of light are delivered through a handpiece.</p>

<p>
A little redness can usually be seen which resolves a few hours after treatment and patient can rejoin the work immediately after treatment. A little darkening can be seen in some areas of the skin which is temporary. A sunblock is applied after treatment. 4-8 treatments take 2-4 weeks.
