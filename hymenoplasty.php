<div class=" col-md-8 ">
             <p>Hymen is a protective membrane that fully or partially covers the external vaginal opening. There is a notion that the presence of the hymen indicates virginity. But, it is a medical fact that hymen may be absent during childbirth itself. Plastic surgeries exist for creating the hymen. However, these tissues are very much fragile and can easily go away with increase in physical activity. For this reason, this surgical procedure is only performed prior to 4-7 days of marriage.</p>
