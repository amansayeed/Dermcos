			<p><b>Non surgical skin tightening and collagen rebuilding – a form of non surgical face lift </b></p>
			
<p>Thread lift is a type of cosmetic procedure used to lift and realign the sagging tissue while adding definition to facial contours through the use of absorbable ‘threads’. This procedure helps to reposition sagging cheeks, lift eyebrows, correct the marionette line, support the neck and improve facial features. The unique design of the barbs of the thread leads the surrounding tissues to hold the threads in their place without any visible scars. For the mid-face procedure, a tiny incision is made very close to the ear and the threads are advanced along the marked contours toward the chin and jaw line, ultimately creating a very firm hold on the underlying tissues without leading to any additional trauma. This procedure can be used for both Men and Women, typically in their thirties to sixties looking for a youthful appearance.</p>

<p><b>Platelet Rich Protein Treatment (PRP)</b></p>

<p><b>Treating Atopic areata, Melasma and facial rejuviation</b></p>
 
 <p>Platelet Rich Protein Treatment (PRP) Also called Drakula therapy, where patients own platelet is injected for treating Fine lines and wrinkles, Irregularities from acne and acne scars, melasma and to improve overall tone and texture of the skin thus giving the skin a youthful glow.  Platelets contain packets of growth hormones and cytokines that tell the tissues to increase rebuilding of tissues to enhance healing. When PRP is injected into the damaged area, it stimulates a mild inflammatory response, which triggers the healing cascade. This leads to restored blood flow, new cell growth, and tissue regeneration. Because the blood is your own, there is no risk of rejection, infection as it is totally bio-compatible and bio-degradable.</p>
