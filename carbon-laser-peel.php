</p>


<li><b>What is a Carbon Laser PeeI?</b></li>
<p>People with blackheads, enlarged pores, dull uneven skin tone, congested skin and pigmentation due to several reasons including, sun damage, inflammation, hormonal changes and acne and drug reactions. Treatments can be performed on any part of the body, including the back and chest.

</p>

<li><b>How Does the Treatment Work?
</b></li>
<p> A layer of liquid carbon is applied to the skin's surface, once evenly distributed- a focused light beam is emitted for a precise and targeted area. The carbon particles actively absorb the light before a vacuum suction gently removes them, along with damaged cells contaminants and oils found in the upper layers of the skin. The simultaneous generation of thermal energy stimulates the synthesis of fresh collagen and the promotion of a healthy-looking complexion. Skin structure is visibly strengthened and even opened pores get purified and cleared
</p>

<li><b>Treatment Benefits! </b></li>
<br>


<b>Cleansing:</b><p>Carbon has the ability to absorb oil and contaminants from deep within the pores. When the laser is passed over the treatment area it targets and destroys the carbon particles, taking any absorbed material with it.
</p>
<b>Exfoliating:</b><p>As the carbon is targeted by the laser, it blasts away dead skin cells and effectively exfoliates the skin. The result is softer, radiant skin with reduced pore size and a more even tone.
</p>

<b>Rejuvenating:</b><p>Carbon peels also target the deep layers of the skin to stimulate collagen production, which in turn produces firmer, plumper skin, reduces wrinkles, and leaves skin feeling tighter and glowing</p>

<li><b>Acne Management 
</b></li>
<p>The heat produced by carbon peels helps in reducing the bacteria responsible for acne, allowing for better management of pimples and it also shrinks oil producing glands, resulting inless oil production. 
As with all skin treatments, carbon peels should be augmented by a good skin-care routine and daily use of a high-spectrum sunscreen. Noticeable results can be experienced after a single treatment, but for maximum long-term results a course of treatments are recommended depending on your skin condition and desired results.</p>
