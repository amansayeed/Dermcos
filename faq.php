            <li> What is Pain-Free Hair-Free?</li>

            </ul>
            
           <p>
	Hair removal is one of the aesthetic medical industry&#39;s most well-known and researched uses of lasers. Pain-Free, Hair-Free technology in our Harmony XL laser has provided permanent hair reduction for thousands of patients worldwide, safely and successfully since it was cleared by the FDA in 2005.</p>

            <li> How many treatments will I need?</li>
            </ul>
            
           <p>
	There are a number of factors that can affect the success of a series of hair removal treatments, but generally, after each treatment, you&#39;ll see a noticeable, permanent reduction in the number of hairs that regrow in the treatment area. Typically, it will require 4 - 6 treatments or more to permanently reduce the number of regrowing hairs by more than 80%, six months after the last treatment. Your physician or spa professional will advise you.</p>

            </ul>
            
           <p>
	The short answer is no. Once the hair follicle is damaged, it cannot grow new hair. However, there are invariably a few hair follicles that manage to partially escape the laser during each treatment. Some of these follicles may be only stunned and will need to be retreated.</p>

            </ul>
            
           <p>
	No. Pain-Free, Hair-Free requires no &quot;down time&quot; or recovery time. You can have a treatment and return to work or school immediately.</p>

            </ul>
            
           <p>Most people find Pain-Free, Hair-Free very comfortable. While pain tolerance is subjective, many patients often describe the sensation as soothing as a "hot stone massage."

If you find it otherwise, talk with your doctor or laser technician.

		Each laser treatment takes just a few minutes. During each session, you may have treatments that involve more than one of the Laser360 technologies.

           <p>
	<em>Creams and lotions</em>can be used at home, but usually provide only a slight benefit and must be used indefinitely to maintain even modest results.</p>
<p>
	Other laser and light-based deviceswork well, but they typically focus on just one aspect of skin rejuvenation (color, texture, or tightening). They may be quite painful, have significant downtime and may not be suitable for all skin types.</p>
<p>
	<em>Surgery</em>may be indicated for extreme cases, but it is much riskier than any non-invasive technique.</p>
<p>
	Laser360 is a non-invasive, comfortable, no downtime procedure that provides lasting results in just 60 days. It combines three technologies to address all aspects of skin rejuvenation and can be used on any skin type.</p>

	<p>
		Laser360 is the ideal procedure to eliminate the discoloration and textural irregularities that make your skin look older. But even after the procedure, you will continue to age and to be affected by the sun and elements.</p>
	<p>
		To maintain the healthy glow that Laser360 can bring, patients may choose to come back periodically for touch-up treatments.</p>

	After a consultation, the decision to treat can most of the time occur that day. Many times you will need several treatments before therapy is complete. Safety is of the utmost importance, so protective equipment will be stressed. Finally, most treatments have no down time and you can go back to the rest of your day.</p>

	Not much. After learning about the benefits it can provide, the injections take only a few minutes to perform right there in the office. There is very minimal to no pain with the injections, and some people might experience minimal bruising, but most people have no trace of anything performed.</p>
