<ul>
<li>Genital herpes is a commonly occurring sexually transmitted disease affecting both men and women equally. The common symptoms of genital herpes include itching, pain and sores in your private parts. People who are infected by this condition face no signs or symptoms of genital herpes. An infected person can, however, infect the other person, even though he or she does not exhibit any visible sores.</li>
<li>The main causative agent of Herpes is Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV). Sexual intimacy with the infected person is the main way of this virus to spread further.  After a person is affected, the virus in the body lies quiescent, which then becomes active several times in a year.
</li>
<li>Whether you are infected with herpes or not is quite difficult to tell because the symptoms are extremely mild in nature that go unnoticed. However,  the initial symptom of genital herpes normally is itching, pain and soreness that begins within a few weeks after exposure to an infected sexual partner. After some days of infection, tiny red bumps or small white blisters generally appear. After their rupturing these ulcers leak or bleed. Ultimately, scab formation takes place  and the ulcers heal.
</li>
<li>In women, these sores commonly erupt in areas like the vagina, external genitalia, anus or cervix. In men, sores tend to appear on the penis, anus, scrotum, buttocks, or thighs or interior portion of the urethra.</li>
<li>This disease can recur based on the following factors: fatigue, presence of other illness, fatigue surgery, and menstruation.
</li>
<li>The Treatment of Genital Herpes is usually the antiviral drugs that helps people to remain symptom-free for a prolonged period. These medications work by reducing the severity and span of symptoms. Drug therapy is not a cure but helps it easier for people to sustain and makes it easier for people with this condition to live easily.  There are three most important drugs that are used extensively to treat genital herpes symptoms: these drugs are 
Famciclovir (Famvir), Acyclovir (Zovirax), and Valacyclovir (Valtrex). These are prescribed in the form of a pill. More severe cases of Herpes are counteracted with the intravenous (IV) drug acyclovir.
</li>
