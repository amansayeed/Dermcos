			<p>Though permanent tattoo removal is a complicated process, Q-switched Nd: YAG laser, that is a frequently used laser for permanent tattoo removal made it less complicated than earlier. Light pulses from the laser are directed on to the tattoo which breaks up the tattoo pigments. Bodyâ€™s own macrophages remove the treated pigmented areas over the next several weeks. One can specifically treat black (which accounts for more than half of all tattoos), green and blue color. </p>
