<p>
Thread lifts are the type of Non-surgical method of skin tightening and collagen rebuilding, which is a form of a non-surgical facelift. 

</p>

<b>Thread lift refers to a type of cosmetic procedure used widely in cosmetic arenas for lifting and realigns the sagging tissue while giving your face the required definition and the depth to your facial contours with the help of absorbable ‘threads’. This system helps in the repositioning of the lift eyebrows, sagging cheeks, aligning the marionette line, supporting the neck and enhancing the facial features. The barbs have a unique design of the thread that helps in surrounding tissues for holding the threads in their place without giving any visible scars. For the mid-face procedure, a small incision is made closer to the ear and the threads are pushed along the marked contours toward the jawline and chin, eventually creating a very firm hold on the underlying tissues without causing any extra trauma. This process is widely used by both Men and Women, who are in their thirties to sixties giving you a more younger appearance.

<h3>Treating Atopic areata, Melasma and facial rejuviation</h3>

<p>Platelet Rich Protein Treatment (PRP), which is also known as Dracula therapy, where your own platelet is injected for treating the signs of ageing such as Fine lines and wrinkles, Variations from acne and acne scars, melasma and for improving the overall texture and tone of the skin thereby giving your skin a juvenile glow. Platelets constitute packets of growth hormones and cytokines that signal the tissues to enhance the rebuilding of tissues to promote healing. When PRP is injected into the affected area, it spurs a mild inflammatory reaction, which triggers the cascade of healing. This causes restoration of the blood flow, tissue regeneration, new cell growth. As it is your own blood thus there is no risk of infection,  rejection, due to its complete bio-compatibiity and biodegradability.
