           <p>There are plenty of nail disorders that are caused due to certain infections, diseases of the skin or are self-induced.  However, with adequate medical intervention, most nails will re-grow and gain back their healthy state. Fungal infection of the nail is amongst the most commonly occurring nail disorders. This infection is more common in the toenails as these are more prone because of the added warmth and dampness in this area that provides an adequate environment for the growth of the fungus. oral antifungals are the best cure for this condition when taken for a few months. </p>
