						<div class=" col-md-8 text-center">
            <p>Skin allergies that are commonly referred to as "rash" is a general term used for the inflammation of the skin. The various causes of rash, includes, but is not limited to, allergic or irritant dermatitis, medications, autoimmune disease, infections and very rare skin cancer.</p>
			<p>Allergic contact dermatitis refers to a condition of the skin that occurs after a person comes in contact with a chemical that acts as an allergen. Common allergens that can cause contact dermatitis are found in detergents, colognes, makeup, soaps. Certain plants like poison ivy or chemicals that are found in the workplace or home can also cause this condition. It is thus important to do allergy testing to determine which chemical may be causing this condition.</p>
			<p>
			Irritant contact dermatitis seems very similar to the allergic contact dermatitis in its appearance, although its aetiology is different. This condition arises by the contact to various chemicals that extensively used every day for the purpose of cleaning and cosmetic use, as well as from chemicals found in the workplace. These chemicals makes your skin inflamed from direct irritation, an Autoimmune disease of the skin occurs when your immune system produces an abnormal response to an allergen. These diseases aggravate due to prolonged sun exposure. Some common examples of autoimmune disease are Psoriasis and Lupus. It is important to make sure that these diseases are not affecting the organs involved.

			
			</p>
			<p>Bacterial, fungal or viral infection can all affect the skin and lead to skin rashes. Bacterial diseases generally come forth as ring-like patches (Lyme disease), pustules, and tender-crusted areas. 


</p>

<p>Ringworm or athletes foot is the fungal infection are also very common skin conditions.</p>
<p>Viral diseases can also cause skin conditions like a herpes infection, chicken pox, and shingles, or in viral illness like Roseola,  an indirect rash appears on the skin. </p>


<p>Medications might also be one of the reasons for the development of a rash. Any medication is capable of causing a rash in any person. Common medications that might begin a  rash are antibiotics and medications for cholesterol or even the medications for high blood pressure.</p>
<p>Cancer can rarely be the cause of the skin rashes. skin cancers that occur superficially like the basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma can come forth as scaly pink patches. Lymphoma of the skin can also appear as a scaly rash on the body..</p>
<p>
These rashes may appear to be the same at first glance, thus it becomes important to consult a dermatologist, who can give you the best solution whenever you face a skin condition that seems problematic.</p>
